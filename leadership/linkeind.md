Be a good person and the rest will follow
I have worked for a lot of amazing leaders, leaders who I admire and who have shaped my mindset, personality and character. Once on my one-on-one walks when I was struggling with a few things, I asked my boss, "What are the traits of a good leader, how are you such an amazing leader, what can I do be one?" I was expecting her to quote Sandberg or Druker and talk about life, after-life, history and philosophy but was stumped when she said, "Just be a good person and the rest will follow." I was impressed by the brevity and yet it sounded too simple to be of practical use. I didn't think she was interested in furthering the conversation, so I just smiled and nodded.

But it stuck with me. It took me a while to realize her meaning and once it clicked, it changed my perspective quite a bit. Once I accepted that I am a person dealing with people and not with engineers/ managers/ resources, my approach changed. I was able to accept the fact that all are growing individuals with opportunities.

To break it down, here are how understanding basic human traits translates to leading an anything but basic team:

We make mistakes and learn from them
Projects will fail, deliverables will be delayed, people will be unhappy, something will always go wrong. As a leader you need to see it through, share your plan-B with the team, tell them you are there for them. Be transparent, be open about mistakes, as leaders we are as much susceptible to mistakes as anyone else, these are the opportunities we get to grow and learn from to do things better.

We are intelligent and emotional
There are days when I am happy, sad, upset, excited, ecstatic, joyous, angry. There are a lot of emotions, that is what we want. We want everyone to bring their full self to work and as a person I do the same. It is not just our intelligence that makes us capable of working together, but emotions help us understand and grow with each other. As leaders, it is our job to ensure everyone has a safe space and optimal environment where great work and individuals can thrive and prosper.

We can be illogical but we listen to each other
We all have crazy ideas sometimes but these crazy ideas could be revolutionary or crazy good! Music on a stick, an app to crash at someone's house, an app to express myself in 140 characters -- these are some crazy ideas and yet, they changed the world. As a leader, ensure your people feel empowered and safe to share their thought process and are encouraged to do so. Even if a crazy idea does not have a place today, shutting down a creative mind will only prevent them from speaking up when they come up with the next revolutionary app. 

Unison and diversity go hand in hand
This is sometimes difficult to comprehend. We want to act as one but at the same time build a team that is diverse. The goal for a leader is to build a team with a mission that everyone is driving toward. This team should be comprised of different skillsets, mindsets, race, gender, orientation. My experience has been the more diverse the team, the faster we progress towards the mission. As a leader, the goal is to put the best people together with a mission that excites them and let the magic happen.

Let go!
This is the part where most of us struggle. It is difficult to let go of success, emotions, failures, feedback. This is what makes us better people and good leaders. The reason why we are doing this is to ensure success is attributed to and owned by the team. In the instance of failure, the team can identify what went wrong, recommend figure out planB and move on. 

Looking at the other successful leaders, they are good people first and they have a genuine interest in making their teams successful. As a leader, accepting the fact that you are person who has some shortcomings but is there to try her best to ensure the success of people around her is the leap and rest will fall in place. Be the source of energy and ideas, be good at what you got you here and above all be a good person, rest will all fall in palace.
